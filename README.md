# Game of Life
A package of classes that implements the Game of Life, which mimics the life of cells that can be born, live or die

Application:
1. Creating an object of class GameOfLife
2. Call the go (float) / go (Point[]) method. The method is overloaded, the principle of creating a grid of cells 100x100 in size (10000 cells) depends on the input values:
	* when passing the float [0; 1] the grid is generated by itself. The transmitted value is a chance of cell nucleation (for example, at a value 	of 0.5, each cell will be born with a probability of 50% chance)
	* when passing the Point array to the method, the circuit will generate the living cells indicated in the array (for this it is necessary to 	create the Point[] array, then memory is allocated for each cell (the constructor of the Point class takes the index of the cell in the grid, for example Point [0] = new Point(5,2))
3. The simulation will continue while the application window is open.
